A Flutter plugin that allows you to compress images easily and quickly.

## Features

- üíô **Made for Flutter**. Easy to use, no config, no boilerplate
- ‚è±  **Parallelism**. Support parallel image compression 
- ü¶Ñ **Open source**. Everything is open source and free forever!

Fast Image Compress can do much more (and we are just getting started)

- üì± **Supported platform**. iOS, Android
- üß™ **Batch processing**. Support batch processing using batchSize
- üñºÔ∏è **Supported image types** jpeg, png and heic

## Installing

1.  Add dependency to `pubspec.yaml`

```dart
dependencies:
    fast_image_compress: <latest_version>
```
or run this command:

```bash
flutter pub add fast_image_compress
```

2.  Import the package
```dart
import 'package:fast_image_compress/fast_image_compress.dart';
```

Use as:

[See full example](https://github.com/SimformSolutionsPvtLtd/fast_image_compress/blob/master/example/lib/main.dart)

There are several ways to use the library api.

```dart

// 1. Compress an image and get Uint8List
Future<Uint8List> compressImage(Uint8List imageData) async {
  final compressedImage = await fastImageCompress.compressImage(
    imageData: imageData,
    quality: 60,
    targetWidth: 400,
    imageQuality: ImageQuality.low,
  );
  return compressedImage;
}

// 2. Compress list of images and get a list of Uint8List
Future<List<Uint8List>> compressMultipleImages(List<Uint8List> imageList) async {
  final result = await fastImageCompress.compressImageList(
    images: imageList,
    quality: 30,
    targetWidth: 800,
    batchSize: 3,
    imageQuality: ImageQuality.low,
  );
  return result;
}
  
// 3. Cancel the compression process
Future<void> _cancelCompression() async {
  await fastImageCompress.cancelCompression();
}

```

## About params

### targetWidth

The `targetWidth` parameter allows you to resize the images to a specific width.

Use this parameter when you need all images to have a uniform width. It is particularly useful for optimizing image processing performance.
Recommended to use this parameter when image size or image width is large.
### batchSize

The `batchSize` parameter determines how many images are processed in a single batch.

- If the image sizes are large (greater than 50 MB), set batchSize to a smaller value to avoid memory issues.
- If the image sizes are small, you can set a higher value (e.g., 6) for better performance.

To dynamically adjust batchSize based on the number of CPU threads available on the device, you can use the following code:
```dart
final maxAvailableCPUThreads = Platform.numberOfProcessors;
final batchSize = maxAvailableCPUThreads > 0 ? maxAvailableCPUThreads ~/ 2 : 1;
```
### imageQuality

The `imageQuality` parameter controls the quality of the processed images. It has three predefined values:
- low
- medium (default)
- high

## Android

You may need to update Kotlin to version `1.5.20` or higher.

## About EXIF information

Using this library, the image orientation is maintained.

#### HEIF(Heic)

##### Heif on iOS

Only support iOS 11+.

##### Heif on Android

Only support API 28+.

Note: Requires hardware encoder support, so availability is not guaranteed on all devices running API 28 or higher.

## Why fast_image_compress

The following bar graph demonstrates the efficiency of our plugin compared to two other existing packages. 
The comparison was conducted by compressing one image at a time for various image sizes, measuring the time taken in milliseconds (Y-axis) against the image size in MB (X-axis).

Below are the comparison graphs:

![iOS Comparison Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimformSolutionsPvtLtd/fast_image_compress/master/preview/iOS_comparison_graph.png)

This visual representation highlights the better performance of our plugin in terms of compression speed and efficiency across different image sizes.
